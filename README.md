## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yarn.lock
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/static`**: This directory will contain all of the static files required by theme such as `favicon`, `logo` and `robot.txt`.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

5.  **`yarn.lock`** (See `yarn.lock` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

6.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

7.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## Configure

```js
//siteConfig.js
module.exports = {
  siteUrl: "https://ghost-novela-preview.draftbox.co",
  postsPerPage: 12,
  siteTitleMeta: "Built with Draftbox",
  siteDescriptionMeta:
    "Lightning fast, secure front-end for your WordPress or Ghost blog, without coding.",
  shareImageWidth: 1000,
  shareImageHeight: 523,
  shortTitle: "Built with Draftbox",
  siteIcon: "favicon.png",
  backgroundColor: "#e9e9e9",
  themeColor: "#15171A",
  apiUrl: "https://ghost.theasdfghjkl.com",
  header: {
    navigation: [
      {
        label: "Home",
        url: "https://ghost-novela-preview.draftbox.co/",
      },
      {
        label: "Contact",
        url: "https://ghost-novela-preview.draftbox.co/contact",
      },
    ],
  },
  footer: {
    copyright: "Built with Draftbox",
    navigation: [
      {
        label: "Home",
        url: "https://ghost-novela-preview.draftbox.co/",
      },
      {
        label: "Sitemap",
        url: "https://ghost-novela-preview.draftbox.co/sitemap.xml",
      },
      {
        label: "RSS",
        url: "https://ghost-novela-preview.draftbox.co/rss.xml",
      },
      {
        label: "Contact",
        url: "https://ghost-novela-preview.draftbox.co/contact",
      },
      {
        label: "External Link",
        url: "https://spectrum.chat/gatsby-js/themes?tab=posts",
      },
    ],
  },
  subscribeWidget: {
    title: "Subscribe to Built with Draftbox",
    helpText: "Get the latest posts delivered right to your inbox.",
    successMessage: "Thanks for subscribing to Built with Draftbox.",
  },
  socialLinks: {
    twitter: "https://twitter.com/draftboxhq",
    facebook: "https://facebook.com/",
    instagram: "https://www.instagram.com/",
    linkedin: "https://linkedin.com",
    github: "https://github.com/draftbox-co",
  },
  contactWidget: {
    title: "Contact Built with Draftbox",
    successMessage: "We‚Äôll get in touch with you soon.",
  },
};
```

In the configuration shown above, the most important fields to be changed are `siteUrl`, `siteTitleMeta` and `siteDescriptionMeta`. Update at least those to fit your needs.

## Ghost Content API keys

All content is sourced from a Ghost CMS. If you don't customize the file `.ghost.json` content is fetched from the demo location at `https://cms.gotsby.org`. Surely you want to source your own content. Change the keys to match your own Ghost CMS Content API keys:

```bash

    {
        "development": {
            "apiUrl": "http://localhost:2368",
            "contentApiKey": "9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942"
        },
        "production": {
            "apiUrl": "http://localhost:2368",
            "contentApiKey": "9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942"
        }
    }
```

## Deploy

```bash
    gatsby build
```

After completion of the build process your static site can be found in the `public/` folder. Copy those files over to your webserver.

## Optimizing

You can disable the default Ghost Handlebars theme front-end by enabling the `Make this site private` flag within your Ghost settings. This enables password protection in front of the Ghost install and sets `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` so your Gatsby front-end becomes the source of truth for SEO.
